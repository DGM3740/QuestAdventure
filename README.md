Welcome to the Project for our DGM3740 Class titled QUESTADVENTURE. The text based game that has the intention of bringing you, the user, back to the 80's. 
This attempted app was created using VueJs. The story for this game is sitting in the `store.js` file and is pulled into `AppGame.vue` using a for loop. Other parts of this amazing app include storing of the name, and inventory. We are so happy and proud of what we have accomplished for this project!
